# Household on the new side

The household piece holds household metadata, agents, members, tokens, sessions,
passkeys, one-time links, push state, member preferences and read marks, and piece
settings in `loom.db`. It reuses the lossless, keyed household row stores already
in core. Existing commands and the old server continue using their current stores.
The importer does not enable any new request path or change the running household.

## Importing for the final move

With the owner present, stop both instances and back up the old home. Run:

```
loom migrate household --home <new-home> --from <stopped-old-home>
```

Both homes must be different directories, and the new home cannot be inside the old one. The destination's household tables must
be empty. The command acquires the destination daemon gate and uses one database
transaction for schema, rows, comparison and receipt. Source files are read only.
The importer compares full reconstructed content (including all ids, optional and
unknown fields), and rechecks the source checksum before committing. Repeating
an unchanged source is a no-op; a changed source is refused, even after later
changes on the new side. A no-op never resets live state to the imported state.

`ui-cookie.key` stays a file, copied byte for byte with exclusive creation and mode
0600; a different destination key is refused. An interrupted import can leave that
same key behind, harmlessly; retry accepts it. No secret is re-minted. Token
hashes, session bindings, passkey public keys/counters and push keys survive exactly.
Missing optional token/session files mean empty stores. A source session file
requires its cookie key; malformed documents fail rather than silently signing
people out. No import runs automatically at startup.

After all pieces are imported, start the new server on the new home and verify
sign-in and stdio continuity. This importer never deletes or rewrites old data;
reverting means restarting the old server on the untouched old home. Context and
commons stores and other key files must be copied as part of the overall move;
they are not app tables and are not imported here.

## Old-to-new mapping

| Old state | New rows |
| --- | --- |
| household.json | household_settings, household_agents, household_members |
| tokens.json / tokens.used.json | household_tokens / household_token_use |
| ui-sessions.json sessions, links, challenges, passkeys | corresponding household tables |
| ui-sessions.json push | household_push |
| ui-sessions.json per-member preferences/read marks | household_readers |
| ui-sessions.json first-owner preferences/read marks and remaining metadata | household_settings envelope |
| pieces/*/settings.json | household_piece_settings |
| ui-cookie.key | byte-identical key file |

The command/route/job replacement table, next-mode authentication, owner operations,
generated clients, offline continuity and Setup screen remain tracked by t-2203.
